# Infona
Infona - Hackathon 2020 Project

This is our technical approach to the Infona app we designed. We are no programmers and had no contact to app programming so far but we wanted to try it anyway. Of course we're not going to learn a complete new language in the short time we had so we used Android Studio to make it a little easier but still challenging.

In the following files you can find some bits and pieces of the code we made work so far. It's very rough and probably not pretty to any experienced programmers but it's something.
